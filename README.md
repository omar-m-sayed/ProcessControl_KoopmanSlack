Model Predictive Control of Process Systems Using Koopman Operators

Introduction

This repository accompanies our paper “Koopman Multi-Step Predictors with Direct Constraint Handling for Efficient Nonlinear MPC via Convex Optimization”.
It provides all the code and materials needed to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out via email at omar.sayed@tu-dortmund.de, or use the Discussions section of this repository for more general/public questions.

The repository is organized into three main sections, as described in the results section of the paper:  

- **Model_data/**  
  Contains the process model equations used in the experiments.  

- **Training/**  
  Includes training scripts for both the proposed Koopman-based models and the baseline approaches.  

- **Control_prediction/**  
  Provides the evaluation setup for prediction and control experiments.  

In addition, the **utils/** folder collects the core methods and helper functions described in the paper.
